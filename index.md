### Pricing

Obviously it's not free. Here is a table with some prices:

|Price| YouTube Video |
|-----| ----------- |
|USD20$ or 1,600R$| Footage up to 30 minutes |
|USD30$ or 2,400R$| Footage up to 45 minutes |
|+USD10$ or +800R$ | Footage +15 minutes |

|Price| TikTok Conversion |
|-----| ----------- |
|USD5$ or 400R$| Video up to 3 minute video length |

|Price| TikTok Conversion |
|-----| ----------- |
|USD5$ or 400R$| Normal thumbnail |
|USD7,50$ or 600R$| Thumbnail + Avatar GFX render |

I would always prefer real money (PayPal), but if it's the only thing you can offer, then it doesn't matter.
